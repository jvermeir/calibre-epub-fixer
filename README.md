==================

Correct line endings for pdf's that are converted to epub by Calibre.

Bit of a niche product this, probably, but here it is anyway.
I read stories published by Tor, by printing 'm as PDF on my Mac. Then I import the PDF into Calibre and convert the file
to EPUB. Unfortunately this conversion appears to preserve line endings intended for A4 pages, which looks weird on my phone's e-reader.
So I used a library published by Paul Siegmann, see http://www.siegmann.nl/epublib to read the EPUB files, remove
some unnecessary line endings and write the file back to disk.
